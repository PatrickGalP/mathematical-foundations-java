# mathematical-foundations-java
Mathematical foundations implemented from first principles in Java.

This project implements core mathematical concepts from first principles,
with emphasis on correctness, invariants and explicit design decisions.

## Scope
- Rational number representation
- Exact arithmetic
- Algebraic properties validation

## Design Principles
- No external libraries
- Explicit invariants
- Small and verifiable code

## Status
Work in progress.
